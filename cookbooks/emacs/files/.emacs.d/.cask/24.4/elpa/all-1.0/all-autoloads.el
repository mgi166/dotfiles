Show all lines in the current buffer containing a match for REGEXP.

If a match spreads across multiple lines, all those lines are shown.

Each line is displayed with NLINES lines before and after, or -NLINES
before if NLINES is negative.
NLINES defaults to `list-matching-lines-default-context-lines'.
Interactively it is the prefix arg.

The lines are shown in a buffer named `*All*'.
Any changes made in that buffer will be propagated to this buffer.
