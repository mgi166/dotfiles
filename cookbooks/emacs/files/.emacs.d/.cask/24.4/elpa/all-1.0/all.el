;;; Commentary:

;; Just like occur, except that changes in the *All* buffer are
;; propagated to the original buffer.

;; You can no longer use mouse-2 to find a match in the original file,
;; since the default definition of mouse is too useful.
;; However, `C-c C-c' still works.

;; Line numbers are not listed in the *All* buffer.

;; Ok, it is _not_ just like occur.

;; Some limitations:

;; - Undo in the *All* buffer is an ordinary change in the original.
;; - Changes to the original buffer are not reflected in the *All* buffer.
;; - A single change in the *All* buffer must be limited to a single match.
